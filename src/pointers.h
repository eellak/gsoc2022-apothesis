/** The pointers class contains pointers to the classes defined in kmc.cpp.
 * Itcreates a common space of all the class instances that are defined in the kmc class.
 * As long as a kmc instance exists these classes are "united" in this common space. So,
 * if someone wants to use the lattice instance from the io instance all that has to do is
 * to call the insance as this defined in the kmc.cpp.
 * For example in kcc.cpp an instance of the class lattice is pLattice and an object of the
 * io class is pIO. If someones wants to use the pIO from pLattice all (s)he has to do is to
 * call pIO-> and the relevant public functionalities of the class. This is very handy to
 * bind together different instances. (Taken from LAMMPS ;) )*/
